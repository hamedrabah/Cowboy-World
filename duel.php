     .45s. A rifle or shotgun would provide much more accuracy to a target,
     especially at a further range. A pistol, which was mainly purchased for
     killing people, could only fire up to thirty yards. If you wanted to protect
     yourself from wild animals out on the range or any neâ€™er-do-wells on your trip
     to town, you would find that a longer barrel was the way to go."
