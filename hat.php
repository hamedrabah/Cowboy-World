  <div id="hatText">"The hat is possibly the most defining staple of the cowboy’s iconic image. The round, curved brim and pinched crown has made the cowboy hat the most recognized piece of Western wear, but it didn’t always have this look.

John B. Stetson, a famous hat manufacturer from Philadelphia created the “Boss of the Plains” hat in 1865. The brim curved up on the sides to stay out of the way of a rope, and the crown became pinched to allow better control.

Today the cowboy hat has become as much a part of fashion as it is function. Adorned by cowboys, cowgirls, rodeo athletes, musicians and movie stars alike, the cowboy hat is a truly traditional item of the West."</div>
