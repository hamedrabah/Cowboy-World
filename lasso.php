  <div class="informationText">"The lasso's greatest effec足tiveness, as a weapon, is when the wielder is mounted. When both ad足versaries are afoot its value is very slight. With cattle or horses it is an entirely different thing. The whole essence of the matter is to tighten the noose around an opponent with a jerk sufficient to dismount him or take him off his feet. To that end you may ride past him, swiftly, or, if pur足suing him, stop your own horse suddenly. Or if he is stationary and you can足not ride past him, you can wheel your own horse and retire after a successful cast.  In lassoing a man, if done skillfully, the instant of time is too brief for him either to throw off the tightening noose or cut it. And it is one of the most deceptive things to attempt to dodge."</div>
